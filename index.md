# markdown-site

Welcome to markdown-site!

This project is a little client-side technology built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript that can allow one to host a folder of
markdown files as a static website, without any compilation step. This content has been written and markdown and is
being rendered by markdown-site.

How does that work? Well, markdown file paths are taken from the location hash and are loaded & rendered within
JavaScript.

How to use? Check the project README for details on how to use this with your own content.
